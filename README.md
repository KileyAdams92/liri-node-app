# liri-node-app

Description:

The LIRI app is similar to SIRI, however LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. Liri takes in the following commands “my-tweets”, “spotify-this-song”, “movie-this”, and “do-what-it-says”. 

With “my-tweets”, Liri provides the last 20 tweets of the user.

With “spotify-this-song”, Liri provides the song “The Sign” if no other song is provided. If a user provides a one-word song title, Liri returns the song name, artist, album name, and preview link. When searching a two-word or more song title, the user will place the song title in quotes: such as “Song Title” in order to retrieve that song. 

With “movie-this”, Liri provides the movie “Mr. Nobody” if no other song is provided. If a user provides a one-word movie title, Liri returns the title of the movie, release year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, country where the movie was produced, language, plot, and actors included. In order to search a two-word or more movie title, the user must place movie title in quotes, such as: “Three Word Title”. 

With “do-what-it-says”, Liri reads a random.txt file and utilizes the information in the file to follow one if the above commands.
